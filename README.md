# BIO-LGCA - a cellular automaton modelling class for analyzing collective cell migration

To overcome drawbacks of classical on-lattice models, we introduce a novel on-lattice, agent-based modelling class for collective cell migration, which we call biological lattice-gas cellular automaton (BIO-LGCA). The BIO-LGCA is characterised by synchronous time updates and the explicit consideration of individual cell velocities.

This Python package includes allows to simulate and visualize classical BIO-LGCA rules in 1D and 2D. 
A guide on how to use the package is included in the form of a Juypter notebook.
