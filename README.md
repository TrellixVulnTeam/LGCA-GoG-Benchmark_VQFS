# BIO-LGCA - A cellular automaton modelling class for analyzing collective cell migration

To overcome drawbacks of classical on-lattice models, we introduce a novelon-lattice, agent-based modelling class for collective cell migration, which we callbiological lattice-gas cellular automaton (BIO-LGCA). The BIO-LGCA is char-acterised by synchronous time updates, and the explicit consideration of individ-ual cell velocities.
